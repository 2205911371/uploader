- Testing!!!!!!!!
- Implement methods.start() upload
   * Add DmUploaderFile.upload()... that will wrap the $.ajax() call
      * Some methods like DmUploaderFile.setStatus/getStatus setXhr/ will not be necesary anymore
- Add some method to reset the plugin (resets ids, empty arrays, free resources, etc..)
- Callback when the upload progress event isn't supported by the browser
- Allow the option to do something like Facebook when draggin-in content:
   ... show/hide (we are goin to just use moar callbacks)
- Add auto-start option (means no queue)...
   ... and maybe maxSimulaneusUploads some day (which is a mix of both)
