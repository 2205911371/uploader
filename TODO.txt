- Testing!!!!!!!!

- Add auto-start option (means no queue)...
   ... and maybe maxSimulaneusUploads some day (which is a mix of both)

- method to know when the upload progress event isn't supported by the browser

- Add some method to reset the plugin (resets ids, empty arrays, free resources, etc..)

- Allow the option to do something like Facebook when draggin-in content:
   ... show/hide (we are goin to just use moar callbacks)
